<h1 style="color:DarkCyan;">Ask Open-Ended Questions</h1>
<p  style="font-size:23px;color:DarkCyan;">Engage children in conversation by asking open-ended questions. These encourage them to think and express themselves.
Examples of open questions include:
“Why do you think that happened?”
“What do you think is going on?</p>
<h2  style="color:Navy;">Listen and Answer Their Questions
</h2>
<p style="font-size:23px;color:Navy;" >Children naturally ask questions while learning. Take time to listen and encourage them to think of answers.
Once they’ve thought of an answer, you can provide additional insights or clarify their understanding.
Remember to ask if you understand their question correctly and whether your answer addressed their query</p>
<h2 style="color:RebeccaPurple ;">Create a Vibrant Learning Environment</h2>
<p style="font-size:23px;color:RebeccaPurple;"> Explore various teaching strategies to make learning enjoyable for young children.
Consider play-based learning, individualized instruction, and other engaging approaches.
Adapt your methods to their developmental stage while challenging them to grow</p>
<h2 style="color:LightSeaGreen ;">Teach Everyday Skills</h2>
<p style="font-size:23px;color:LightSeaGreen;">Focus on practical skills that children can apply in their daily lives.
Examples include tying shoelaces, brushing teeth, telling time, and basic hygiene.
Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and celebrate their progress</p>
